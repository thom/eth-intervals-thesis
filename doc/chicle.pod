make B<help>|B<man>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Chicle> is a simple framework for writing and publishing LaTeX documents.

=head2 What does chicle mean?

Chicle is the gum from Manilkara chicle, a species of sapodilla
tree. It is a tropical evergreen tree, native to in Central America
and South America. It is the traditional material used in chewing
gum.

The tree is also grown for its fruit which is plum-sized and has a
translucent brown flesh. The tapping of the gum is similar to the
tapping of latex from the rubber tree. Zigzag gashes are made in the
tree trunk and the dripping gum is collected in small bags. Locals
who collect chicle are called chicleros. This is then boiled till it
reaches the correct thickness. Widespread tapping has lead to the
tree becoming scarce and other sources like the related Balata
(Manilkara bidentata) are being increasingly used. Many modern
chewing gums use petroleum based plastic instead of chicle.

Chicle was well known to the Aztec and Maya Indians and the early
European settlers prized it for its subtle flavour and high sugar
content.
