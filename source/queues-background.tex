\section{Work-Stealing Queues}
\label{sec:queues-background-work-stealing-queues}

A work-stealing scheduler employs a fixed number of threads called
workers. Each worker has a local queue to maintain its own pool of
ready tasks from which it obtains work. When a worker finds that its
pool is empty, it becomes a thief and steals a task from the pool of a
victim worker chosen at random.

There are different implementations for work-stealing queues. While
some use LIFO or FIFO extraction \cite{Michael2009}, most
work-stealing schedulers use work-stealing deques to manage ready
tasks \cite{Arora2001, Acar2002, Blumofe1995, Frigo1998,
  Danaher2005}. A work-stealing deque is like a deque \cite{Knuth1997}
except that only the deque's owner thread puts and takes local work to
and from the deque's bottom end. To minimize synchronization overhead
for the deque's owner, elements are stolen from the top end of the
deque.

All work-stealing queues provide the following three methods in their
interface:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline!put(WorkItem workItem)!: Puts \lstinline!workItem!
  into the queue.
\item \lstinline!WorkItem take()!: Takes an object from the queue if
  the queue is not empty, otherwise returns \lstinline!null!.
\item \lstinline!WorkItem steal()!: If the queue is empty, returns
  \lstinline!null!. Otherwise, returns the element successfully stolen
  from the queue, or returns \lstinline!null! if this worker loses a
  race with another worker to steal or take a work item.
\end{itemize}

Note that the \lstinline!put! and \lstinline!take! methods are invoked
only by the queue's owner.


\section{Current Queue Implementation}
\label{sec:queues-background-current-implementation}

\todo[inline]{Finish section ``Current Queue Implementation''}

The queue currently used by the intervals scheduler is the lazy
work-stealing deque. It is called ``lazy'' because the owner of the
deque only lazily updates the location of the deque's head. This means
it only updates the head when it tries to take something and finds it
is gone.

The members of the lazy deque are defined as:

\lstinputlisting[style=Listing,
  caption={Lazy deque}, 
  label=lst:work-stealing-lazy-deque]{
    ../listings/queues-background/WorkStealingLazyDeque.java
}

The \lstinline!workItems! array contains the work items of the
queue. The \lstinline!ownerHead! and \lstinline!ownerTail! are indices
in the array and represent the head and tail of the queue for the
owner. \lstinline!thief! is both the lock object used when a thief
tries to steal a work item and also represents the head for the thief.

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline!put(WorkItem item)!: Puts \lstinline!item! onto the
  bottom of the deque.
\item \lstinline!WorkItem take()!: Takes an object from the bottom of
  the deque if the deque is not empty, otherwise returns
  \lstinline!null!.
\item \lstinline!WorkItem steal()!: If the deque is empty, returns
  \lstinline!null!. Otherwise, returns the element successfully stolen
  from the top of the deque, or returns \lstinline!null! if this
  process loses a race with another process to steal the topmost
  element. \lstinline!null! is also returned if a \lstinline!steal!
  operation lost a race with an array memory reclamation caused by a
  concurrent \lstinline!take! operation.
\end{itemize}

% At the core of the ABP algorithm is an efficient scheme for stealing
% an item in a non-blocking manner from an array-based deque, minimizing
% the need for costly Compare-and-Swap (CAS)\footnote{The CAS (location,
%   old-value, new-value) operation atomically reads a value from
%   location, and writes new-value in location if and only if the value
%   read is old-value. The operation returns a boolean indicating
%   whether it succeeded in updating the location.} synchronization
% operations when fetching items locally.

% \subsection{A Java fork/join framework \cite{Lea2000}}

% Task allocation itself is the responsibility of the JVM. Java garbage
% collection relieves us of needing to create a special-purpose memory
% allocator to maintain tasks. This substantially reduces the complexity
% and lines of code needed to implement intervals compared to similar
% frameworks in other languages. The basic structure of the deque
% employs the common scheme of using a single (although resizable) array
% per deque, along with two indices: The top index acts just like an
% array-based stack pointer, changing upon put and take. The bottom
% index is modified only by steal.

% Because the deque array is accessed by multiple threads, sometimes
% without full synchronization, yet individual Java array elements
% cannot be declared as volatile, each array element is actually a fixed
% reference to a little forwarding object maintaining a single volatile
% reference. This decision was made originally to ensure conformance
% with Java memory rules, but the level of indirection that it entails
% turns out to improve performance on tested platforms, presumably by
% reducing cache contention due to accesses of nearby elements, which
% are spread out a bit more in memory due to the indirection.

% The main challenges in deque implementation surround synchronization
% and its avoidance. Even on JVMs with optimized synchronization
% facilities, the need to obtain locks for every put and take operation
% becomes a bottleneck.  However, adaptations of tactics taken in Cilk
% \cite{Frigo1998} provide a solution based on the following
% observations:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item The put and take operations are only invoked by owner threads.
% \item Access to the steal operation can easily be confined to one
%   stealing thread at a time via an entry lock on steal. This deque
%   lock can also serve to disable steal operations when
%   necessary. Thus, interference control is reduced to a two-party
%   synchronization problem.
% \item The take and steal operations can only interfere if the deque is
%   about to become empty. Otherwise they are guaranteed to operate on
%   disjoint elements of the array.
% \end{itemize}

% Defining the top and bottom indices as volatile ensures that a take
% and steal can proceed without locking if the deque is sure to have
% more than one element. This is done via a Dekker-like algorithm in
% which put pre-decrements top:

% \begin{lstlisting}
% if (--top >= bottom) ...
% \end{lstlisting}

% and steal pre-increments bottom:

% \begin{lstlisting}
% if (++bottom < top) ...
% \end{lstlisting}

% In each case they must then check to see if this could have caused the
% deque to become empty by comparing the two indices. An asymmetric rule
% is used upon potential conflict: take rechecks state and tries to
% continue after obtaining the deque lock (the same one as held by
% steal), backing off only if the deque is truly empty. A steal
% operation instead just backs off immediately, typically then trying to
% steal from a different victim. This asymmetry represents the only
% significant departure from the otherwise similar THE protocol used in
% Cilk.

% The use of volatile indices also enables the put operation to proceed
% without synchronization unless the deque array is about to overflow,
% in which case it must first obtain the deque lock to resize the
% array. Otherwise, simply ensuring that top is updated only after the
% deque array slot is filled in suppresses interference by any steal.
