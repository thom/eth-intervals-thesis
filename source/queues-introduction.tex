\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:queues-intro-motivation}

The intervals implementation uses a work-stealing scheduler. It
employs a fixed number of threads called workers. Each worker has a
local double-ended queue, or deque, to maintain its own pool of ready
intervals from which it obtains work. When a worker finds that its
pool is empty, it becomes a thief and steals an interval from the pool
of a victim worker chosen at random.

% The performance of work-stealing algorithms is in a large part
% determined by the efficiency of their work queue implementations.

To enable efficient and scalable execution, management of the work
queues must be made as fast as possible. In the non-blocking
work-stealing algorithm,\footnote{Non-blocking -- in contrast to
  wait-free \cite{Herlihy1991} -- means that it is possible for a
  worker to starve while trying to steal from other
  workers. Live-locks cannot occur as if one worker starves, then
  others must be making progress.} the deques are implemented with
non-blocking synchronization \cite{Arora2001}. That is, instead of
using mutual exclusion, it uses powerful atomic synchronization
primitives such as Compare-and-Swap \cite{Moir1997}. The current deque
implementation of intervals however uses mutual exclusion when trying
to steal.

Our hypothesis was that we could improve the performance of the
intervals scheduler with non-blocking queues. Thus, as a separate
effort, we designed and explored alternative non-blocking queue
implementations.

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:queues-intro-overview}

Chapter \ref{chap:queues-background} summarizes the properties of
work-stealing queues and introduces ``lazy deque'', the queue
currently used by the intervals scheduler. Chapter
\ref{chap:queues-implementation} describes the investigated queue
implementations. None of the approaches we developed as part of this
research yielded a queue that was improving work-stealing performance
on the machines we had to test them with (Appendix
\ref{sec:experimental-setup-marvin} and
\ref{sec:experimental-setup-mafushi}). Possible reasons for this are
given in the performance evaluation in Chapter
\ref{chap:queues-performance}. Chapter \ref{chap:queues-conclusions}
concludes and summarizes the encountered problems in order to preserve
this research for future reference.
