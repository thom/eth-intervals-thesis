\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{chap:abstract}

Intervals are a new, higher-level primitive for parallel programming
which permits programmers to directly construct the program
schedule. They are under active development at ETH ZÃ¼rich as part of
the PhD research of Nicholas D. Matsakis.

The intervals implementation in Java uses a work-stealing scheduler
where a worker running out of work tries to ``steal'' work from
others. The scope of this thesis is to improve the performance of the
intervals scheduler.

We implement and analyze locality-aware scheduling of
intervals. Locality-aware scheduling allows each interval to be given
an affinity for a place, and when a worker belonging to a certain
place obtains an interval, it gives priority to the intervals with
affinity for the place.

The performance of work-stealing schedulers is in a large part
determined by the efficiency of their work queue implementations. In
the non-blocking work-stealing scheduler \cite{Arora2001}, the deques
are implemented with non-blocking synchronization. That is, instead of
using mutual exclusion, its deques use atomic synchronization
primitives such as Compare-and-Swap. The current deque implementation
of intervals however uses mutual exclusion when trying to steal. Thus,
as a separate effort, we design and explore alternative non-blocking
queue implementations with the aim to improve work-stealing
performance.
