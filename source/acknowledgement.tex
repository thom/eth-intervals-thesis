\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank my thesis advisor, Nicholas D. Matsakis, for his
support and guidance throughout this work. Thank you for numerous
hours of discussions, valuable inputs, and advice.

My thanks also go to Zoltán Majó who provided me with helpful insight
into the memory hierarchy of the NUMA architecture and supported me
when I had questions with the testing machine.

Further, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Thomas R. Gross for giving me the
opportunity to carry out my thesis in his group.

Finally, I thank all my family and friends. It is because of the
constant support of my loved ones that I was able to complete the work
successfully.
