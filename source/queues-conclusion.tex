\todo[inline]{Finish chapter ``Conclusion''}

We could not find a huge difference when running the benchmarks using
the alternative queue implementations. The paper ``Enabling
scalability and performance in a large scale CMP environment''
\cite{Saha2007} states that there is no noticeable difference between
the speedup of work-stealing and global shared work queue when using
not more than 8 cores.

To check this hypothesis, we rewrote the intervals scheduler to use a
single shared work deque and use it in a LIFO (stack) manner.
