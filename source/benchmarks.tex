\chapter{Java Grande Forum Benchmarks}
\label{chap:appendix-benchmarks}

We evaluate the \emph{intervals} scheduler implementation with a
variety of parallel Java Grande Forum benchmarks \cite{Smith2001,
  Mathew1999, Gregg2003} that have been ported to use
\emph{intervals}.

The following is a summary of the benchmarks described in
\cite{Smith2001, Mathew1999, Gregg2003}.

\subsection*{Crypt}

Crypt performs IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)
encryption and decryption of an array of $N$ bytes. This algorithm
involves two principle loops, whose iterations are independent and are
divided using fork-join sections between \emph{intervals} in a block fashion.

\subsection*{LUFact}

This benchmark solves an $N \times N$ linear system using LU factorization
followed by a triangular solve. Iterations of the double loop over the
trailing block of the matrix are independent and the work is divided
between \emph{intervals} in a cyclic fashion using fork-join sections.

\subsection*{SOR}

The benchmark performs iterations of successive over-relaxations on a
$N \times N$ grid. It involves an outer loop over iterations and two
inner loops, each looping over the grid. In order to parallelize the
loop over array rows, a ``red-black'' ordering mechanism is used. The
work is distributed between \emph{intervals} in a block manner with
help of point-to-point synchronization.

\subsection*{Series}

This benchmark computes the first $N$ fourier coefficients of the
function $f(x) = (x+1)^x$ on the interval $0,2$. It uses fork-join
sections to distribute the loop over the Fourier coefficients between
\emph{intervals}.

\subsection*{MolDyn}

The MolDyn benchmark models particles interacting under a
Lennard-Jones potential in a cubic spatial volume with periodic
boundary conditions. The calculation is distributed between
\emph{intervals} in a cyclic manner and synchronization is done using
barriers.

\subsection*{MonteCarlo}

This benchmark is a financial simulation, using Monte Carlo techniques
to price products derived from the price of an underlying asset. The
work is divided between \emph{intervals} by using fork-join sections.

\subsection*{RayTracer}

This benchmark measures the performance of a 3D ray tracer rendering a
scene containing 64 spheres at a resolution of $N \times N$
pixels. The loop over rows of pixels has been distributed to
\emph{intervals} using fork-join sections.
